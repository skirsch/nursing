# US Nursing home analysis
You can load up the code in R-studio and run it and replicate my results.

Nobody has pointed out any bugs in the code.

You can also use excel to replicate my results. It will output an excel spreadsheet file called "nursing_ALL" in the data directory.

See the analysis directory for the spreadsheet with 
"nursing_ALL." That's the file with the R output with my commentary and excel plots.

Based on [data avaiable from CMS](https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data).

Look in the analysis directory and find the nursing_state_week_groups.xlsx. The CFR remained flat, with short increases after the vax rollout. The vaccines DID NOT REDUCE MORTALITY. THEY LIED.
